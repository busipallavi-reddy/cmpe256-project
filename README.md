# CMPE256-Project
## Recommendation System for Microsoft Annonymous Web Data
```
In this project we are using Microsoft web data(users and URLs visited), to recommend URLs to a user that he or she might visit. We have used Collaborative filtering to recommend URLs based on similar users and similar items. We have also used SVD(Single Value Decomposition) for dimensionality reduction and to recommend URLs.
